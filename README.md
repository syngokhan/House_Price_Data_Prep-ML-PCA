#House Prices Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms

# Business Problem

**It is desired to carry out a machine learning project regarding the prices of different types of houses by using the dataset of each house's features and house prices.**

# Dataset Story

**This dataset of residential homes in Lowa, Ames contains 79 explanatory variables.**

**You can reach the dataset and competition page of the project, which also has a competition on Kaggle, from the link below.**

**Because the dataset belongs to a kaggle competition, there are two different csv files, train and test.**

**House prices are left blank in the test dataset and you are expected to estimate these values.**

# Variables

**Train dataset consists of 1460 observations and 81 variables, and Test dataset consists of 1459 observation units.**

**The Turkish definitions of the variables in the dataset can be found at the address below.**

**Total Observation ----> 1460**
**Numeric Variable ----> 38**
**Categorical Variable ----> 43**
